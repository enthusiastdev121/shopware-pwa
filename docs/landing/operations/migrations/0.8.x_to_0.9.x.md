# Changes description and Migrate version 0.8.x to 0.9.x <Badge text="canary" type="warning"/>

## Nuxt config changes <Badge text="BREAKING CHANGE" type="error"/>

In order to provide better experience we want to keep your `nuxt.config.js` file as clean as possible.
You can now safely remove all things you didn't put there by yourself. Newly generated `nuxt.config.js` file can look like this

```js
import extendNuxtConfig from "@shopware-pwa/nuxt-module/config";

export default extendNuxtConfig({
  head: {
    title: "Your Shop Name",
    meta: [{ hid: "description", name: "description", content: "" }],
  },
});
```

::: tip
It will not break your current project, but not using `extendNuxtConfig` method can cause troubles in the future. That's why this is marked as a breaking change

## Native TypeScript support

You can use TypeScript natively across the project, plugins, theme and logic.
Just add `<script lang="ts">` in your components to start using it there. All your files can be written in `.ts` files.

## [default-theme] Upgrading to Vuelidate v2 (potential Breaking Change)

We upgraded validation library to fully use possibilities of Composition API.
If you encounter some problems with validation please follow Vuelidate's migration guide: https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/migration_guide.html

Basic migration has 3 steps:

1. changing imports
2. removing mixin from component
3. adding `$v: useVuelidate(),` in setup's `return`

## [default-theme] Upgrading to Storefront-ui v0.10 (potential Breaking Change)

With this release, we upgraded storefront-ui to the newest version. This required style improvements and changes in multiple components. Potentially it may break some styling in your overwritten components, shouldn't be anything too hard to fix though.
