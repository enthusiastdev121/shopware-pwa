# Migrate version 0.8.x to 0.9.x <Badge text="canary" type="warning"/>

## Nuxt config changes <Badge text="BREAKING CHANGE" type="error"/>

In order to provide better experience we want to keep your `nuxt.config.js` file as clean as possible.
You can now safely remove all things you didn't put there by yourself. Newly generated `nuxt.config.js` file can look like this

```js
import extendNuxtConfig from "@shopware-pwa/nuxt-module/config";

export default extendNuxtConfig({
  head: {
    title: "Your Shop Name",
    meta: [{ hid: "description", name: "description", content: "" }],
  },
});
```

::: tip
It will not break your current project, but not using `extendNuxtConfig` method can cause troubles in the future. That's why this is marked as a breaking change
