// we're importing here main style variables
@import "@theme/assets/scss/variables";

// For available variables check SFUI docs - https://docs.storefrontui.io/customization.html#global-variables
//
// Please remember to ONLY override variables here, as it will be used in components.
// If you'd add some styles here as well it would be included in almost every component. You don't want it ;) You can add global styles in main.scss file.
